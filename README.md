# CustomSliderView
Custom Slider View in SwiftUI

Allows custom background and sliding views via the .backgroundView() and .slidingView() methods.

Binds sliding to a percentage Double to enable logic based on the user's sliding.

I present a couple examples here so you can see the use cases.

Feel free to use as-is or as inspiration.
Could be updated to include vertical sliders as well.
